Not all chemical identifiers are created equal. This project is about ways of linking different kinds of identifiers (especially authority-controlled numeric IDs with open structure-based IDs) using public data, limited resources, and Python.


## Requirements

The chemex package and the scripts (`scripts/`) require:
* Python 2.7
* future
* xlrd
* numpy

The [IPython](http://ipython.org/) notebooks (`notebooks/`) were written in Python 3, and additionally use:
* requests
* pandas

## Fine print

Files in `data/` are either from the public domain, or were generated from public data sources.

Everything else here is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain (see `LICENSE`).

Not all chemical identifiers are created equal. This project is about ways of linking different kinds of identifiers (especially authority-controlled numeric IDs with open structure-based IDs) using public data, limited resources, and Python.


## Requirements

The [IPython](http://ipython.org/) notebooks use:
* Python 3
* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* requests
* xlrd

The currently non-existent app will eventually use:
* Python 2.7
* [Clastic](https://github.com/mahmoud/clastic)
